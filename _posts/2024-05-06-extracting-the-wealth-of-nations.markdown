*"Therefore your gates shall be open continually; They shall not be shut day or night, That men may bring to you the wealth of the Gentiles, And their kings in procession."* Isaiah 60:11

> Today's writeup is a very short one, I was thinking recently on how to extract the wealth of nations. A lot of countries are termed as rich when you have liquid money, enough things to negotiate with people or leverage/value to provide people.
>
> If we look at life like a video game, the wealth of the game is in the system, it has always been in the system and it takes a good player to amass it. Of course wealth is not the only goal in a system but it is one of the goals, depending on what you want to do.

> So it seems think system, understand the system you are in. Face the reality not the game you want to be in. Be a good player( max up your easiest stats) and acquire co-skills that will help you reach your goal to a level. And remember to trust God because the game is rigged in your favor.

**10 **“One time during the mating season, I had a dream and saw that the male goats mating with the females were streaked, speckled, and spotted. **11 **Then in my dream, the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ And I replied, ‘Yes, here I am.’

**12 **“The angel said, ‘Look up, and you will see that only the streaked, speckled, and spotted males are mating with the females of your flock. For I have seen how Laban has treated you. **13 **I am the God who appeared to you at Bethel,\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2031&version=NLT#fen-NLT-887a "See footnote a")\] the place where you anointed the pillar of stone and made your vow to me. Now get ready and leave this country and return to the land of your birth.’” Genesis 30: 10-11
